This repository contains my daily JavaScript practice code.  
I'm starting from the basics and working my way up to advanced topics â€” one step at a time!

## ðŸ“… Goal
Practice JavaScript **every day** and build a strong foundation in:
- Variables & Data Types
- Loops & Conditions
- Functions
- DOM Manipulation
- Arrays & Objects
- Mini Projects (like calculator, to-do app, etc.)

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
Each folder contains code for one day or one topic.
